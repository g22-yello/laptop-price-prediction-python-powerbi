## üîç Project Workflow  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Importing  
- Loaded the dataset using `pandas`.  
- Reviewed data structure, types, and missing values.  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing  
- Handled missing values, duplicates, and outliers.  
- Encoded categorical variables.  
- Normalized numerical features for consistent scaling.  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Engineering  
- Derived new insights from existing columns (e.g., pixel density, storage type).  
- Removed redundant or non-informative columns.  

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Visualized data trends and correlations.  
- Identified key variables influencing laptop prices.  
- Used heatmaps, histograms, and pairplots for pattern discovery.  

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Model Development  
- Split data into training and test sets.  
- Implemented models including **Linear Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **XGBoost**.  
- Evaluated models using metrics like **RMSE**, **R¬≤**, and **MAE**.  

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Hyperparameter Tuning  
- Used **GridSearchCV** for model optimization.  
- Selected the best-performing model for final deployment.  

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Real-Time Predictions  
- Built a prediction function to estimate laptop prices from user input.  

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Power BI Dashboard  
- Imported cleaned dataset into Power BI.  
- Designed interactive visuals and filters for:  
  - Average price by brand  
  - Price trends by RAM, CPU, GPU  
  - Price distribution by storage type or OS  
- Developed an executive summary for business stakeholders.
